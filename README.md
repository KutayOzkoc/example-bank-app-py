# Example Banking App With Python

I plan to develop a new banking application. It will be a small-scale application and as I learn Python, I want to show you the development of this application as I learn as I share it with you. I think it would be good for you if you create a repo with me and follow your development. I will make the application development on github and I will be constantly adding the things I have learned to the application by committing. Hope to develop together…

You can send me all your questions on X, Github and here.

Thank you for your support.
